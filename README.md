# Project 3: Around The U.S.

**Intro**

In this project, the goal was to create a webpage that can adapt to different sized devices (i.e, mobile, tablet, and desktop) with smooth transitions at specific screen dimensions. To accomplish this goal, a mix of flex and grid displays was incorporated. This allowed the site to be flexible enough to adapt to all screen sizes. In addition to grid and flex displays, the following properties were included as well:

- Media Inquiries
- Max-width
- Grid-template-areas and columns
- Pseudo-classes
- Border properties including radius and color
- Images

Created using HTML and CSS based on the outline provided by the TripleTen SE Team.
