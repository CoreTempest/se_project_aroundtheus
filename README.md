# Project 3: Around The U.S.

**Intro**

In this project, my goal was to create a webpage that can adapt to different sized devices (i.e, mobile, tablet, and desktop) with smooth transitions at specific screen dimensions. To accomplish this goal, a mix of flex and grid displays has been incorporated. This allows the site to be flexible enough to adapt to any screen size. In addition to grid and flex displays, the following properties were included as well:

- Media Inquiries
- Max-width
- Grid-template-areas and columns
- Pseudo-classes
- Border properties including radius and color
- Images

JavaScript was added in the most recent edition of the website and includes commands such as:

- Event Listeners
- Functions
- Element Identifiers

Created using HTML, CSS, and JS based on an outline provided by the TripleTen SE Team.
